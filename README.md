# Sanskrit Notes

A collection of my notes as I learn _saṃskṛtaṃ_. 
- In progress - Solutions to the sanskrit guide from [www.learnsanskrit.org/guide/](https://www.learnsanskrit.org/guide/). See the annotated pdf [here](https://github.com/arvindb95/Sanskrit_notes/blob/main/learnsanskrit_online_guide_annotated.pdf).

  This is a well made study guide with curated examples and a very friendly teaching method.
